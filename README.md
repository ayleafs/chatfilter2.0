# ChatFilter 2.0
A better chat filter mod inspired by [luaq's chat filter](https://github.com/luaqs/chatfilter).

## What is it?
This allows you to filter out annoying messages in chat, not very user-friendly because it utilizes regex. You can filter messages out completely, change how they look, and perform actions (macros).

## How to use
Do `/chatfilter` and from there you can create or manage your filters. Replacements and actions get performed using basic regex replacements ($1, $2, etc.).
